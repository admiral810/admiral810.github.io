  <p>I am an innovative, analytical, customer focused professional desiring to continue my career in providing solutions for customers and internal stakeholders using stories developed through data interpretation.  I have experience with operator, industry, menu, consumer, and category datasets â€“ which I enjoy leveraging to provide insights on category management, sales & marketing strategies, market performance, and research & development. 
  <br />
  <br />
    In my current Sr. Manager role within the Product Team at Technomic I manage two of the newer big data products Technomic has brought to market.  Volumix is a product that tracks operator back of house purchasing information at a SKU level, assisting suppliers in understanding category performance, price, competition, and other operator purchasing insights. Transaction Insights is a restaurant operator and industry tracker that leverages electronic payment, geo location, and other data sources modelled to project restaurant brand level performance.
